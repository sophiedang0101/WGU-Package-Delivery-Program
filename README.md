## WGU-C950-Package-Delivery-Program
- A Python program with a CLI interface simulates an efficient mail truck delivery route between three trucks and two drivers.
- The Nearest Neighbor algorithm was implemented to calculate and establish an optimized route, reducing three trucksâ€™ distance to 103.0 miles.
- A chaining hash table was used to ensure rapid and efficient O (1) time complexity for operations including searching, inserting, storing, and retrieving package details.
